                    <p>
                        My passion for technology is immense and it has been growing along the years.
                        Starting with self-taught curiosity, I have explored a world I genuinely enjoy and pursued
                        my dreams of becoming a programmer. As a student, I am eager to dive even deeper into
                        this field of technology and will continue to increase my knowledge and develop new skills.

                        <p>
                            My first project with the Godot engine. I was asked to recreate the game "Asteroids" with a twist,
                            the player can only move the ship backwards by firing. The project was challenging, however it was
                            rewarding as it taught me how the physics in the engine worked, and how I could use it in my future
                            projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through this project, valuable knowledge about Godot's scripting language, GDScript, scene system, and physics engine
                            was gained and has made me further interested in game development. I also gained experience in making 2D pixelated art,
                            as all sprites were made by me.

                        <p>
                            This project was one of my final projects for a game development class, as I had to work alongside three other members
                            in a team. In Felt Knight, you ward against many monsters in endless waves that are trying to take you down.
                            Potions drops that give you powers are also available, and will aid you along your survival.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I learned how to use git in a team environment, with creating branches for different features and merging
                            our work together. Additionally, I learned how to implement model, view, controller pattern for games.

                            This project was one of my first projects on the web solely focused on event listeners. This recreation of an "Etch-a-Sketch"
                            allows users to resize the board from 1x1 to 100x100 pixels, draw, erase, and change colours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was my first exposure to JavaScript, and it gave me experience with dynamically changing the DOM tree, flexbox, and
                            event listeners and handlers.

                            This project is a simple functional calculator that performs basic mathematical operations, such as
                            addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is clean and user friendly, and has 
                            error handling such as division by zero.

                            This project was made for additional practice with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It shows I am capable of 
                            building practical, everyday tools through code.
